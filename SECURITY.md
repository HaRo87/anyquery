# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As Anyquery is in active development and not yet in a stable release, don't expect any LTS versions. 
The only supported version is the last one, and users are expected to update their software to the latest version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please send an email to [contact@anyquery.dev](mailto:contact@anyquery.dev).
Never open an issue for it.

Please don't expect any bounty as Anyquery has an annual budget of $10 (for the domain name).
I would love to provide some but Anyquery is a small open-source project without any funding.
