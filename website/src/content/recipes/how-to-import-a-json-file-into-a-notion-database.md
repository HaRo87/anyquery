# How to Import a JSON File into a Notion Database

Anyquery is a SQL query engine that allows you to run SQL queries on pretty much anything. This tutorial will guide you through the process of importing a JSON file into a Notion database using Anyquery.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- A working [installation of Anyquery](https://anyquery.dev/docs/#installation)
- The Notion plugin installed (`anyquery install notion`)
- A Notion database to import the data into. You need to create this database in Notion beforehand.

### Set Up the Connection

1. **Install the Notion Plugin:**

    ```bash
    anyquery install notion
    ```

2. **Get Your Notion API Key:**
    - Go to [Notion's My Integrations page](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations).
    - Click on `+ New integration` and fill in the required information.
    - Save the integration and copy the integration token.
    - Share the database with the integration by going to the database, clicking on the three dots at the top-right corner, and selecting `Share`.

3. **Configure the Notion Plugin in Anyquery:**
    When prompted, provide the API key and the database ID (found in the URL of the database).

## Importing the JSON File

### Step 1: Read the JSON File

The `read_json` function helps to read the JSON file. 

```sql
SELECT * FROM read_json('path/to/your/file.json');
```

Replace `'path/to/your/file.json'` with the actual path to your JSON file.

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Table for the JSON Data

Create a virtual table for better handling and readability.

```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE json_data USING json_reader('path/to/your/file.json');
```

### Step 3: Insert JSON Data into the Notion Database

Ensure your Notion database schema matches the JSON data schema. For example, let's assume your JSON contains fields like `name`, `age`, and `email`.

```sql
INSERT INTO notion_database (name, age, email)
SELECT name, age, email FROM json_data;
```

This command will transfer the data from the JSON file into the specified Notion database.

## Example

Let's say your JSON file (`data.json`) has the following structure:

```json
[
    {"name": "John Doe", "age": 30, "email": "john.doe@example.com"},
    {"name": "Jane Smith", "age": 25, "email": "jane.smith@example.com"}
]
```

1. **Read the JSON File:**

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM read_json('data.json');
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Table:**

    ```sql
    CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE json_data USING json_reader('data.json');
    ```

3. **Insert JSON Data into Notion Database:**

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO notion_database (name, age, email)
    SELECT name, age, email FROM json_data;
    ```

## Conclusion

You have successfully imported a JSON file into a Notion database using Anyquery. This method can be adapted to any JSON structure and Notion database schema. For more information on available functions and customization, refer to the [Anyquery documentation](https://anyquery.dev/docs/usage/*).
