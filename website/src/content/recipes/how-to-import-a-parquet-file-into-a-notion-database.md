# How to Import a Parquet File into a Notion Database

Anyquery is a SQL query engine that allows you to run SQL queries on pretty much anything, including Parquet files and Notion databases. In this tutorial, we will import a Parquet file into a Notion database using Anyquery.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- A working [installation of Anyquery](https://anyquery.dev/docs/#installation)
- The Notion plugin installed. Refer to the [Notion integration guide](https://anyquery.dev/integrations/notion) to install and authenticate the Notion plugin.
- The Parquet plugin is included with Anyquery by default.

## Step 1: Create a Notion Database

Create a table in Notion that matches the schema of your Parquet file. You need to create the table in Notion before using it in Anyquery because Anyquery cannot create tables in Notion.

### Example Notion Database

Let's assume we have the following Parquet file schema:

| Column Name | Data Type |
|-------------|-----------|
| name        | TEXT      |
| age         | INTEGER   |
| email       | TEXT      |
| country     | TEXT      |

Create a table in Notion with the same columns:

1. Open Notion and create a new page.
2. Add a Table database and name it (e.g., "People").
3. Add columns: 
    - name (Text)
    - age (Number)
    - email (Email)
    - country (Text)

## Step 2: Import the Parquet File

### Connect to the Notion Database

To connect to the Notion database, install the Notion plugin and authenticate it following the instructions in the [Notion integration guide](https://anyquery.dev/integrations/notion). 

### Import Parquet File

Run the following SQL query to import data from the Parquet file into the Notion database. 

```sql
INSERT INTO notion_database (name, age, email, country) 
SELECT name, age, email, country FROM read_parquet('path/to/your/file.parquet');
```

Replace `notion_database` with the name of your Notion table, and `path/to/your/file.parquet` with the path to your Parquet file.

### Example Command

If your Notion table is named "People" and your Parquet file is located at `~/Downloads/people.parquet`, the command would be:

```bash
anyquery -q "INSERT INTO People (name, age, email, country) SELECT name, age, email, country FROM read_parquet('~/Downloads/people.parquet')"
```

## Conclusion

You have successfully imported data from a Parquet file into a Notion database using Anyquery. You can now explore and manipulate your data in Notion. For more information on the Notion plugin, refer to the [Notion integration guide](https://anyquery.dev/integrations/notion). For more details on working with Parquet files, see the [Parquet documentation](https://anyquery.dev/docs/usage/querying-files).
