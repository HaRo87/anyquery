# How to Export a Notion Database to a CSV File

Anyquery is a powerful SQL query engine that enables you to run SQL queries on various data sources, including Notion databases. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the steps to export a Notion database to a CSV file using Anyquery.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- A working [installation of Anyquery](https://anyquery.dev/docs/#installation)
- [Configured Notion integration](https://anyquery.dev/integrations/notion)

To set up the Notion integration, follow these steps:

1. **Create an Integration in Notion**:
    - Go to the [Notion My Integrations page](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations).
    - Click on `+ New integration` and create a new integration.
    - Note the `Integration Token`.

2. **Share Your Database with the Integration**:
    - Open the database in Notion.
    - Share the database with the integration you created.

3. **Install the Notion Plugin in Anyquery**:
    ```bash
    anyquery install notion
    ```

4. **Configure the Notion Plugin**:
    - Run Anyquery and follow the prompts to enter the integration token and the database ID.

## Exporting Notion Database to CSV

Once the Notion integration is set up, you can easily query your Notion database and export the results to a CSV file. Follow these steps:

1. **Open Anyquery Shell**:
    ```bash
    anyquery
    ```

2. **Run SQL Query on Notion Database**:
    - Query the Notion database to retrieve the desired data. Replace `notion_database` with the name of your Notion database in Anyquery:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM notion_database;
    ```

3. **Export to CSV**:
    - Exit the shell mode and run the following command to export the query result to a CSV file:
    ```bash
    anyquery -q "SELECT * FROM notion_database" --csv > notion_database.csv
    ```

## Example

Hereâ€™s a complete example of exporting a Notion database named `my_tasks` to a CSV file:

1. **Open Anyquery Shell**:
    ```bash
    anyquery
    ```

2. **Query the `my_tasks` Database**:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM my_tasks;
    ```

3. **Export to CSV**:
    ```bash
    anyquery -q "SELECT * FROM my_tasks" --csv > my_tasks.csv
    ```

## Conclusion

You've successfully exported your Notion database to a CSV file using Anyquery. This tutorial covered the essential steps from setting up the Notion integration to running SQL queries and exporting the results.
